        "# Supervised Learning: Regression Models and Performance Metrics |\n",
        "1. What is Simple Linear Regression (SLR)? Explain its purpose.\n",
        "--> Simple Linear Regression (SLR) is a statistical technique that models the relationship between one independent variable (X) and one dependent variable (Y) using a straight line.\n",
        "Its purpose is to predict the value of Y based on X and to understand how changes in X affect Y.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. What are the key assumptions of Simple Linear Regression?\n",
        "-->Linearity: The relationship between X and Y must be linear.\n",
        "Independence: Observations must be independent of one another.\n",
        "Homoscedasticity: The variance of residuals should be constant.\n",
        "Normality of residuals: Errors should follow a normal distribution.\n",
        "No multicollinearity: (Not relevant for simple regression since only one predictor.)\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Write the mathematical equation for a simple linear regression model and explain each term.\n",
        "-->Y: Dependent variable\n",
        "X: Independent variable\n",
        "b₀: Intercept (value of Y when X = 0)\n",
        "b₁: Slope (change in Y for one-unit change in X)\n",
        "ε: Error term representing unexplained variation\n",
        "\n",
        "4. Provide a real-world example where simple linear regression can be applied.\n",
        "-->Predicting house prices based on square footage.\n",
        "Here,\n",
        "X = area of the house\n",
        "Y = house price\n",
        "A linear model can show how price increases as area increases.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the method of least squares in linear regression?\n",
        "--> The method of least squares finds the regression line by minimizing the sum of the squared differences between actual Y values and predicted Y values.\n",
        "The line with the smallest total squared error is chosen as the best fit.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What is Logistic Regression? How does it differ from Linear Regression?\n",
        "-->Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm used to predict categorical outcomes (e.g., yes/no, pass/fail).\n",
        "\n",
        "Differences:\n",
        "Logistic Regression. \tLinear Regression\n",
        "Predicts categories. \tPredicts numeric values\n",
        "Output is probability.  (0–1)\tOutput is continuous\n",
        "Uses sigmoid function.  Uses straight line model\n",
        "\n",
        "7.  Name and briefly describe three common evaluation metrics for regression models.\n",
        "-->Mean Absolute Error (MAE): Average of absolute differences between predicted and actual values.\n",
        "Mean Squared Error (MSE): Average of squared differences; penalizes large errors more.\n",
        "Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): Square root of MSE; interpretable in the same unit as target variable.\n",
        "\n",
        "8.  What is the purpose of the R-squared metric in regression analysis?\n",
        "-->R-squared measures how much of the variance in the dependent variable.\n",
